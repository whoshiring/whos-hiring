At this point, they have a few separate apps that perform similar things, and they want to create one full new app and integrate everything into one experience. The backend will be all java/Spring Boot/Cassandra, while the front end will be all React. They also have other similar apps built in recent versions of Angular. Understanding of TDD is important as well (they are using cypress currently). They are also looking to move to 100% cloud running on GCP.

 <li>Strong team collaboration and communication</li> 
 <li>Experience with cloud is a big plus (They use GCP)</li>

Employee pay is based on factors like relevant education, qualifications, certifications, experience, skills, seniority, location, performance, union contract and business needs.

  <br> With Flex Work, we’re combining the best of both worlds: in-person time and remote. Our approach enables our teams to deepen connections, maintain a strong community, and do their best work. We know that flexibility can take shape in many ways, so rather than a number of required days in-office each week, we simply spend at least half (50%) of our time each quarter in the office or in the field with our customers, prospects, and partners (depending on role). This means you'll have the freedom to create a flexible schedule that caters to your business, team, and personal needs, while being intentional to make the most of time spent together. Those in our remote ""home office"" roles also have the opportunity to come together in our offices for important moments that matter.

   <div>
     Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.
    <br> 
    <br> So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.
    <br> 
    <br> Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

   <p> Square’s purpose is economic empowerment; since the company’s beginning, we have been helping numerous people start and manage their own businesses. During the pandemic, many small businesses struggled, as they scramble to adapt to going online to reach their customers.</p>
   <p> The Orders team has a mission to enable sellers to reach their customers anywhere, and provide a seamless experience to the customers (e.g. buy online, pickup in store) that today might only be available from much larger merchants. We have already started rolling out to a small percentage of sellers, with a goal of expanding this to all sellers. Furthermore, we strive to build an Orders platform that empowers both teams at Square and an ecosystem of third-party developers to support our sellers in this bright future ahead.</p>
   <p> This is a massive undertaking with huge challenges. We have a wide range of sellers with many different needs, and to meet those needs, we work with many stakeholder teams at Square in navigating dependencies and intertwined technical / product ambiguities. As we scale to more sellers, we also have new obstacles to overcome on performance and reliability. The team has been growing rapidly, and that has brought its own scalability challenges, so we are re-examining our rituals to support the team.</p>
   <p> As a backend engineer on the Orders Core API team, you will help build API solutions for our first and third-party customers that support our mission of empowering our sellers to succeed by helping them throughout their entire business lifecycle. Our API solutions need to support high-volume with low-latency and be reliable.</p>

   <ul>
    <li> Help lead the design/development of Orders API solutions that are used by first and third-party developers to interact with the orders platform</li>
    <li> Lead by example and help foster a culture of positivity, psychological safety, and inclusivity within the team</li>
    <li> Work with other engineers and PM’s across multiple teams to gather requirements, design, develop, test, launch, and maintain features</li>
    <li> Mentor other engineers and contribute to the direction of the team</li>
    <li> Provide technical expertise and guidance to other engineers (both on our team and outside of our team)</li>
    <li> Help maintain and improve the processes we use to manage our work</li>
    <li> Be excited to work in the middle of the Orders ecosystem and solve complex problems that require high availability and reliability</li>
    <li> Be on-call for the applications our team owns</li>
